# Challenge-Project-1-Accessibility

## Description
I refactored existing code for a webpage to add semantic HTML elements for accessibility purposes. Specifically, I replaced non-descriptive tag names with semantic names that could be understood by a screen reader. Additionally, I consolidated repetitive lines of code in the CSS file and added comments and extra line breaks in the HTML file for readability.
